## Linguist Expand
This script changes default Github language bar:
- It moves the language bar just above the latest commit area and below the branch (where it was before Github updated it)
- The language bar is larger than the original and does not contain `1px` dividers between bar segments
- The new language bar does not censor smaller percentages under 'Other' category, meaning that all languages in the repo will be listed correctly

Check out the images on this page for an example of what it looks like.
